# Slime Farm
SEI-23 Project 1

- VanillaJS, HTML, CSS
- sprites drawn in Piskel
- theme & sound effects written with Magical 8 Bit Plug

Features:
- Level design (grid size, sprite spawn rates, score benchmarks)
- Duration & location of sprite spawning randomized
- Wild slime attacks chance-based; probability of successful attack decreases with higher player score
- Event listener applied to wild slimes when enough gems are collected; gems can be traded for opportunity to counterattack wild slimes, which adds to overall score
- localStorage to keep track of highest score attained for each level
